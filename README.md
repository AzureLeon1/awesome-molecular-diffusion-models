> This is a collection of papers on leveraging **Diffusion Models** in **Molecular Generative Tasks**. It's based on our survey paper: **Diffusion Models for Molecules: A Survey of Methods and Tasks**.

Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful generative framework with significant applications in molecular science. These models are particularly well-suited for a variety of downstream tasks, including *de novo* molecular generation, molecular optimization, conformer generation, and molecular docking. This approach represents a cutting-edge intersection of AI and molecular science, offering innovative solutions to traditional challenges in molecular design and analysis.

To facilitate further understanding and exploration of molecular diffusion models, this repository provides a curated list of research papers. These selected papers highlight the innovative applications of diffusion models in molecular generative tasks.

*This repository is still a work in progress. If you would like to add other awesome papers, please feel free to create a pull request or contact `liang.wang@cripac.ia.ac.cn` .*
